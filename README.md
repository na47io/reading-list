# reading list

vibecoded ass [reading list](https://reading-list-bmiwd.sprites.app/) to help me pick the next book

## the general vibe
- no tick-boxes next to books cos they're not to tick off they are to __read__ and __enjoy__
- kept the llm structure cos why not
- if i make it far enough thru this list i...will...become a linkedin thought-leader
- or certified libertharian uncle

## deploy

run this 

```bash
sprite exec -- wget -O /home/sprite/public/index.html https://raw.githubusercontent.com/na47io/reading-list/main/reading-list.html
```

or make a git hook to run it for you
