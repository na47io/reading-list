# reading list

vibecoded ass [reading list](https://reading-list-bmiwd.sprites.app/) to help me pick the next book

## the general vibe
- no tick-boxes next to books cos they're not to tick off they are to __read__ and __enjoy__
- kept the llm structure cos why not
- if i make it far enough thru this list i...will...become a linkedin thought-leader
- or certified libertharian uncle
